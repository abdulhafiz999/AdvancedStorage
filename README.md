# AdvancedStorage – Solidity Concepts: Mappings, Events, and Data Locations

## Project Overview
This project builds on the basic **SimpleStorage** contract by integrating advanced Solidity concepts like **mappings**, **events**, and **data locations** (storage, memory, and calldata). The goal is to enhance the contract’s functionality and give hands-on experience with these topics, focusing on their impact on data management and efficiency within smart contracts.

## Key Features and Implementations

### 1. Mappings
- **Objective**: Demonstrate efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Implementation**: A mapping was added to associate names with their favorite numbers. The `addPerson` function was modified to store data in this mapping, allowing for quick and efficient access.
  
### 2. Events
- **Objective**: Enable logging for better interaction with external applications.
- **Implementation**: An event called `NumberUpdated` was created to log whenever a favorite number is updated. This was integrated into the `storeNumber` function to emit the `NumberUpdated` event upon each update.

### 3. Data Locations (Storage, Memory, Calldata)
- **Objective**: Illustrate the use of `storage`, `memory`, and `calldata` for data management.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Storage**: A persistent variable was used to store the favorite number.
  - **Memory**: A function was created to utilize memory variables for temporary calculations.
  - **Calldata**: A function was implemented to take a `calldata` string parameter, processing it without modifying the original input.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Mapping Setup**: Initializing and modifying the mapping required careful handling to avoid overwriting data. Consulting Module 2.5 of the Solidity Programming 101 course helped streamline the process.
- **Event Logging**: Ensuring that the event emitted the correct values upon each function call required thorough testing.
- **Data Location Understanding**: Differentiating between `storage`, `memory`, and `calldata` and understanding their gas impacts took extra research, which clarified their use in various function types.

## Getting Started
